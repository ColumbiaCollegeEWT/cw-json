CW: Working with JSON
=====================

For this exercise, you're going to work with a pre-built JSON object.
You'll need to create markup for each object in the JSON and add that markup to a container.

You should create all the markup using jQuery.

See the comments in the supplied `games.js` file for specific instructions.
